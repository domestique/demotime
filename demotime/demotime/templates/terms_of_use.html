<h2>Terms of use</h2>

<p>Effective starting: July 1, 2016</p>

<p>This Domestique Customer Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between you and
Domestique Studios (ABN 53 102 443 916) (“Domestique”). If you are agreeing to
this Agreement not as an individual but on behalf of your company, then
“Customer” or “you” means your company, and you are binding your company to
this Agreement. Domestique may modify this Agreement from time to time, subject
to the terms in Section 26 (Changes to this Agreement) below.</p>

<p>By clicking on the “I agree”, "Register" (or similar button) that is
presented to you at the time of your account creation, or by using or accessing
Domestique products, you indicate your assent to be bound by this
Agreement.</p>

<p>1 Scope of the Agreement. This Agreement governs your initial purchase as
well as any future purchases made by you that reference this Agreement. This
Agreement includes our Privacy Policy, our Acceptable Use Policy, any Orders,
and any other referenced policies and attachments. This Agreement applies to
Domestique add-ons or plugins that you purchase from Domestique.</p>

<p>2 Types of Domestique Products. This Agreement governs (a) Domestique’s
commercially available downloadable software products (currently designated as
"Server" or "Data Center" deployments) (“Software”), (b) Domestique’s hosted or
cloud-based solutions (currently designated as "Cloud" deployments) (“Hosted
Services”), and (c) any related support or maintenance services provided by
Domestique. Software and Hosted Services, together with related Documentation,
are referred to as “Products”. The Products and their permitted use are further
described in Domestique’s standard documentation (“Documentation”). Section 6
(Software Terms) applies specifically to Software, and Section 7 (Hosted
Services Terms) applies specifically to Hosted Services, but unless otherwise
specified, other provisions of this Agreement apply to all Products.</p>

<p>3 Account Registration. You may need to register for an Domestique account
in order to place orders or access or receive any Products. Any registration
information that you provide to us must be accurate, current and complete. You
must also update your information so that we may send notices, statements and
other information to you by email or through your account. You are responsible
for all actions taken through your accounts.</p>

<h3>4 Orders.</h3>

<p>4.1 Directly with Domestique. Domestique’s Product ordering documentation or
purchase flow (“Order”) will specify your authorized scope of use for the
Products, which may include: (a) number and type of Authorized Users (as
defined below), (b) storage or capacity (for Hosted Services), (c) numbers of
licenses, copies or instances (for Software), or (d) other restrictions or
billable units (as applicable, the “Scope of Use”). The term “Order” also
includes any applicable Product or Support and Maintenance renewal, or
purchases you make to increase or upgrade your Scope of Use.</p>

<p>4.2 Reseller Orders. This Agreement applies whether you purchase our
Products directly from Domestique or through Domestique “Experts” or other
authorized resellers (each, a “Reseller”). If you purchase through a Reseller,
your Scope of Use shall be as stated in the Order placed by Reseller for you,
and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order. Resellers are
not authorized to make any promises or commitments on Domestique’s behalf, and
we are not bound by any obligations to you other than what we specify in this
Agreement.</p>

<p>5 Authorized Users. Only the specific individuals for whom you have paid the
required fees and whom you designate through the applicable Product
(“Authorized Users”) may access and use the Products. Some Products may allow
you to designate different types of Authorized Users, in which case pricing and
functionality may vary according to the type of Authorized User. Authorized
Users may be you or your Affiliates’ employees, representatives, consultants,
contractors, agents, or other third parties who are acting for your benefit or
on your behalf. You may also permit your customers to have limited access to
certain Products as Authorized Users, subject to the terms of our Customer Use
Addendum. You may increase the number of Authorized Users permitted to access
your instance of the Product by placing a new Order or, in some cases, directly
through the Product. In all cases, you must pay the applicable fee for the
increased number of Authorized Users. You are responsible for compliance with
this Agreement by all Authorized Users. All use of Products by you and your
Authorized Users must be within the Scope of Use and solely for the benefit of
you or your Affiliates. “Affiliate” means an entity which, directly or
indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or is controlled by or is under common
ownership or control with a party, where “control” means the power to direct
the management or affairs of an entity, and “ownership” means the beneficial
ownership of 50% (or, if the applicable jurisdiction does not allow majority
ownership, the maximum amount permitted under such law) or more of the voting
equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.</p>

<h3>6 Software Terms.</h3>

<p>6.1 Your License Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Domestique grants you a non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable and
non-transferable license to install and use the Software during the applicable
License Term in accordance with this Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use,
and the Documentation. The term of each Software license (“License Term”) will
be specified in your Order. Your License Term will end upon any termination of
this Agreement, even if it is identified as “perpetual” or if no expiration
date is specified in your Order.</p>

<p>6.2 Number of Instances. Unless otherwise specified in your Order, for each
Software license that you purchase, you may install one production instance of
the Software on systems owned or operated by you (or your third party service
providers so long as you remain responsible for their compliance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement). We also make available “developer” licenses
free of charge for certain of our Software offerings to allow you to deploy
non-production instances, such as for staging or QA purposes. Details for how
to request non-production licenses are available on our website.</p>

<p>6.3 Your Modifications. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including without limitation Section 2 (Combining the Products with
Open Source Software) of Third Party Code in Domestique Products): (1) for any
elements of the Software provided by Domestique in source code form, and to the
extent permitted in the Documentation, you may modify such source code solely
for purposes of developing bug fixes, customizations and additional features
for the Software and (2) you may also modify the Documentation to reflect your
permitted modifications of the Software source code or the particular use of
the Products within your organization. Any modified source code or
Documentation constitutes “Your Modifications”. You may use Your Modifications
solely with respect to your own instances in support of your permitted use of
the Software but you may not distribute the code to Your Modifications to any
third party. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Domestique has no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or
liability with respect to Your Modifications or their combination, interaction
or use with our Products. You shall indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from
and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in
connection with any claim brought against us by a third party relating to Your
Modifications (including but not limited to any representations or warranties
you make about Your Modifications or the Software) or your breach of this
Section 6.3. This indemnification obligation is subject to your receiving (i)
prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time
for you to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and
direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all
reasonably necessary cooperation of Domestique at your expense.</p>

<p>6.4 Third Party Code. The Software includes code and libraries licensed to
us by third parties, including open source software. See Third Party Code in
Domestique Products for additional provisions regarding our use of third party
code.</p>

<h3>7 Hosted Services Terms.</h3>

<p>7.1 Access to Hosted Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Domestique grants you a non-exclusive right to access and use the
Hosted Services during the applicable Subscription Term (as defined below) in
accordance with this Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use and the
Documentation. If Domestique offers client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile
application) for any Hosted Service, you may use such software solely with the
Hosted Service, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You
acknowledge that our Hosted Services are on-line, subscription-based products
and that we may make changes to the Hosted Services from time to time.</p>

<p>7.2 Subscription Terms and Renewals. Hosted Services are provided on a
subscription basis for a set term specified in your Order (“Subscription
Term”). Except as otherwise specified in your Order, all subscriptions will
automatically renew for periods equal to your initial Subscription Term (and
you will be charged at the then-current rates) unless you cancel your
subscription. If you cancel, your
subscription will terminate at the end of then-current billing cycle, but you
will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid
prior to such termination.</p>

<p>7.3 Credentials. You must ensure that all Authorized Users keep their user
IDs and passwords for the Hosted Services strictly confidential and not share
such information with any unauthorized person. User IDs are granted to
individual, named persons and may not be shared. You are responsible for any
and all actions taken using your accounts and passwords, and you agree to
immediately notify Domestique of any unauthorized use of which you become
aware.</p>

<p>7.4 Your Data. “Your Data” means any data, content, code, video, images or
other materials of any type that you upload, submit or otherwise transmit to or
through Hosted Services. You will retain all right, title and interest in and
to Your Data in the form provided to Domestique. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, you hereby grant to Domestique a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free right to (a) collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify and
create derivative works of Your Data, in each case solely to the extent
necessary to provide the applicable Hosted Service to you and (b) for Hosted
Services that enable you to share Your Data or interact with other people, to
distribute and publicly perform and display Your Data as you (or your
Authorized Users) direct or enable through the Hosted Service. Domestique may
also access your account or instance in order to respond to your support
requests.</p>

<p>7.5 Security. Domestique implements security procedures to help protect Your
Data from security attacks. However, you understand that use of the Hosted
Services necessarily involves transmission of Your Data over networks that are
not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any of
Your Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks. We cannot
guarantee that our security procedures will be error-free, that transmissions
of Your Data will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will
never be able to defeat our security measures or those of our third party
service providers.</p>

<p>7.6 Storage Limits. There may be storage limits associated with a particular
Hosted Service. These limits are described in the services descriptions on our
websites or in the Documentation for the particular Hosted Service. Domestique
reserves the right to charge for additional storage or overage fees at the
rates specified on our website. We may impose new, or may modify existing,
storage limits for the Hosted Services at any time in our discretion, with or
without notice to you.</p>

<h3>7.7 Responsibility for Your Data.</h3>

<p>7.7.1 General. You must ensure that your use of Hosted Services and all Your
Data is at all times compliant with our Acceptable Use Policy and all
applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations
(“Laws”). You represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all necessary
rights, releases and permissions to provide all Your Data to Domestique and to
grant the rights granted to Domestique in this Agreement and (ii) Your Data and
its transfer to and use by Domestique as authorized by you under this Agreement
do not violate any Laws (including without limitation those relating to export
control and electronic communications) or rights of any third party, including
without limitation any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or
rights of publicity, and any use, collection and disclosure authorized herein
is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable privacy policies. Other
than its security obligations under Section 7.5 (Security), Domestique assumes
no responsibility or liability for Your Data, and you shall be solely
responsible for Your Data and the consequences of using, disclosing, storing,
or transmitting it.</p>

<p>7.7.2 Sensitive Data. You will not submit to the Hosted Services (or use the
Hosted Services to collect): (i) any personally identifiable information,
except as necessary for the establishment of your Domestique account; (ii) any
patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by HIPAA or
any similar federal or state laws, rules or regulations; or (iii) any other
information subject to regulation or protection under specific laws such as the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (or related rules or regulations) ((i) through (iii),
collectively, “Sensitive Data”). You also acknowledge that Domestique is not
acting as your Business Associate or subcontractor (as such terms are defined
and used in HIPAA) and that the Hosted Services are not HIPAA compliant.
“HIPAA” means the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as
amended and supplemented. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary,
Domestique has no liability under this Agreement for Sensitive Data.</p>

<p>7.7.3 Indemnity for Your Data. You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Domestique from and against any loss, cost, liability or damage, including
attorneys’ fees, for which Domestique becomes liable arising from or relating
to any claim relating to Your Data, including but not limited to any claim
brought by a third party alleging that Your Data, or your use of the Hosted
Services in breach of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the
intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable law. This
indemnification obligation is subject to your receiving (i) prompt written
notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for you to
respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the
investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable
necessary cooperation of Domestique at your expense.</p>

<p>7.8 Removals and Suspension. Domestique has no obligation to monitor any
content uploaded to the Hosted Services. Nonetheless, if we deem such action
necessary based on your violation of this Agreement or in response to takedown
requests that we receive following our guidelines for Reporting Copyright and
Trademark Violations, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Hosted Services or
(2) suspend your access to the Hosted Services. We will generally alert you
when we take such action and give you a reasonable opportunity to cure your
breach, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the
Hosted Service or other users, we may suspend your access immediately without
notice. You will continue to be charged for the Hosted Service during any
suspension period. We have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your
Data from or suspending your access to any Hosted Services as described in this
section.</p>

<p>7.9 Deletion at End of Subscription Term. We may remove or delete Your Data
within a reasonable period of time after the termination of your Subscription
Term.</p>

<p>7.10 Service-Specific Terms. Some of our Hosted Services may be subject to
additional terms specific to that service as set forth in our Service-Specific
Terms.</p>

<p>8 Support and Maintenance. Domestique will provide the support and
maintenance services for the Products described in the Domestique Support
Policy (“Support and Maintenance”) during the period for which you have paid
the applicable fee. Support and Maintenance is subject to the terms of the
Domestique Support Policy and will be provided at the support level and during
the support term specified in your Order. The Domestique Support Policy may be
modified by Domestique from time to time to reflect process improvements or
changing practices. Support and Maintenance for Software includes access to New
Releases, if and when available. You may use any New Releases that we provide
to you during a valid support term in the same way that you use Software, and
New Releases are included in the definition of Software in that case. “New
Releases” are bug fixes, patches, major or minor releases, or any other
changes, enhancements, or modifications to the Software that we make generally
commercially available.</p>

<h3>10 Returns and Financial Terms.</h3>

<p>10.1 Return Policy. As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, it
is our customary business practice to allow customers to return a Product
within 30 days of payment for any reason or no reason and to receive a refund
of the amount paid for the returned Product. In the context of Software, a
return means that we will disable the license key that allowed the Software to
operate. In the context of Hosted Services, a return means that we will disable
access to the Hosted Service. We will not accept returns after the 30-day
return period. You understand that Domestique may change this practice in the
future in accordance with Section 26 (Changes to this Agreement).</p>

<p>10.2 Delivery. We will deliver the applicable license keys (in the case of
Software) or login instructions (in the case of Hosted Services) to the email
addresses specified in your Order when we have received payment of the
applicable fees. All deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic. For
the avoidance of doubt, you are responsible for installation of any Software,
and you acknowledge that Domestique has no further delivery obligation with
respect to the Software after delivery of the license keys.</p>

<p>10.3 Payment. You agree to pay all fees in accordance with each Order.
Unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will pay all amounts in U.S.
dollars at the time you place your Order. Other than as expressly set forth in
Section 10.1 (Return Policy) and Section 20 (IP Indemnification by Domestique),
all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable. In making
payments, you acknowledge that you are not relying on future availability of
any Products beyond the current License Term or Subscription Term or any
Product upgrades or feature enhancements. If you add Authorized Users during
your License Term or Subscription Term, we will charge you for the increased
number of Authorized Users pursuant to the then-currently applicable rates in
your next billing cycle. You agree that we may bill your credit card for
renewals, additional users, and unpaid fees, as applicable. If you purchase any
Products through a Reseller, you owe payment to the Reseller as agreed between
you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that we may terminate your rights to
use Products if we do not receive our corresponding payment from the
Reseller.</p>

<p>10.4 Taxes. Your payments under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties
payable in respect of the Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is
either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are
payable by Domestique, you must pay to Domestique the amount of such taxes or
duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, you may have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as
of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed. In that case, you will
have the right to provide to Domestique any such exemption information, and
Domestique will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as
may enable you to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid from any
relevant revenue authority if such a refund or credit is available.</p>

<p>11 No-Charge Products. We may offer certain Products to you at no charge,
including free accounts, trial use, and access to Beta Versions as defined
below (“No-Charge Products”). Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any
additional terms that we specify and is only permitted for the period
designated by us. You may not use No-Charge Products for competitive analysis
or similar purposes. We may terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at
any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.
You understand that any pre-release and beta products we make available (“Beta
Versions”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are
likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Products. We
make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available.
In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta
Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 11
(No-Charge Products). All information regarding the characteristics, features
or performance of Beta Versions constitutes Domestique’s Confidential
Information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all
obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any
Support and Maintenance, warranty, and indemnity obligations.</p>

<p>12 Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement,
you will not: (a) rent, lease, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative
works of, distribute, sell, sublicense, transfer, or provide access to the
Products to a third party, (b) use the Products for the benefit of any third
party, (c) incorporate any Products into a product or service you provide to a
third party, (d) interfere with any license key mechanism in the Products or
otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Products intended to limit your use, (e)
reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to
obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or
non-public APIs to any Products, except as permitted by law, (f) remove or
obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in any Product, or (g)
publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Products.</p>

<h3>13 Your Development of Add-Ons.</h3>

<p>13.1 License to Developer Guides. From time to time, Domestique may publish
SDK’s or API’s and associated guidelines (“Developer Guides”) to allow you to
develop plugins, extensions, add-ons or other software products or services
that interoperate or are integrated with the Products (“Add-Ons”). You may
distribute your Add-Ons to third parties, but only for those Products permitted
by Domestique, and only in accordance with the Developer Guides.</p>

<p>13.2 Conditions to Development of Add-Ons. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Domestique has no support, warranty, indemnification
or other obligation or liability with respect to your Add-Ons or their
combination, interaction or use with the Products. You shall indemnify, defend
and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages,
losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim brought against us by a
third party relating to your Add-Ons (including but not limited to any
representations or warranties you make about your Add-Ons) or your breach of
this Section.</p>

<p>14 License Certifications and Audits. At our request, you agree to provide a
signed certification that you are using all Products pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, including the Scope of Use. You agree to allow us, or our
authorized agent, to audit your use of the Products. We will provide you with
at least 10 days advance notice prior to the audit, and the audit will be
conducted during normal business hours. We will bear all out-of-pocket costs
that we incur for the audit, unless the audit reveals that you have exceeded
the Scope of Use. You will provide reasonable assistance, cooperation, and
access to relevant information in the course of any audit at your own cost. If
you exceed your Scope of Use, we may invoice you for any past or ongoing
excessive use, and you will pay the invoice promptly after receipt. This remedy
is without prejudice to any other remedies available to Domestique at law or
equity or under this Agreement. To the extent we are obligated to do so, we may
share audit results with certain of our third party licensors or assign the
audit rights specified in this Section to such licensors.</p>

<p>15 Ownership and Feedback. Products are made available on a limited license or access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”. Domestique and its licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Products (including all No-Charge Products), their “look and feel”, any and all related or underlying technology, and any modifications or derivative works of the foregoing created by or for Domestique, including without limitation as they may incorporate Feedback (“Domestique Technology”). From time to time, you may choose to submit comments, information, questions, data, ideas, description of processes, or other information to Domestique, including sharing Your Modifications or in the course of receiving Support and Maintenance (“Feedback”). Domestique may in connection with any of its products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. No Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement limits Domestique's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>

<p>16 Confidentiality. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each
party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and
financial information disclosed to such party (“Receiving Party”) by the
disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of
the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is
identified as confidential at the time of disclosure. Any Domestique Technology
and any performance information relating to the Products shall be deemed
Confidential Information of Domestique without any marking or further
designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will
hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The
Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which
the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known
to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become
public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully
obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any
confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of
the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party
may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a
regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to
comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing
Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential
Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a
sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving
Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in
addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section shall not operate as a separate warranty with respect to
the operation of any Product.</p>

<p>17 Term and Termination. This Agreement is in effect for as long as you have
a valid License Term or Subscription Term (the “Term”), unless sooner
terminated as permitted in this Agreement. Either party may terminate this
Agreement before the expiration of the Term if the other party materially
breaches any of the terms of this Agreement and does not cure the breach within
thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach. Either party may also
terminate the Agreement before the expiration of the Term if the other party
ceases to operate, declares bankruptcy, or becomes insolvent or otherwise
unable to meet its financial obligations. You may terminate this Agreement at
any time with notice to Domestique, but you will not be entitled to any credits
or refunds as a result of convenience termination for prepaid but unused
Software, Hosted Services subscriptions, or Support and Maintenance. Except
where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by
either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to
any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise. Once
the Agreement terminates, you (and your Authorized Users) will no longer have
any right to use or access any Products, or any information or materials that
we make available to you under this Agreement, including Domestique
Confidential Information. You are required to delete any of the foregoing from
your systems as applicable (including any third party systems operated on your
behalf) and provide written certification to us that you have done so at our
request. The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of
this Agreement: Sections 7.7.3 (Indemnity for Your Data), 10.3 (Payment), 10.4
(Taxes), 11 (No-Charge Products) (disclaimers and use restrictions only), 12
(Restrictions), 13.2 (Conditions to Development of Add-Ons), 14 (License
Certifications and Audits), 15 (Ownership and Feedback), 16 (Confidentiality),
17 (Term and Termination), 18.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 19 (Limitation of
Liability), 21 (Third Party Vendor Products), 24 (Dispute Resolution), 25
(Export Restrictions), and 27 (General Provisions).</p>

<h3>18 Warranty and Disclaimer.</h3>

<p>18.1 Due Authority. Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal
power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that, if you are an
entity, this Agreement and each Order is entered into by an employee or agent
of such party with all necessary authority to bind such party to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>18.2 WARRANTY DISCLAIMER. ALL PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND DOMESTIQUE
AND ITS SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS
OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FUNCTIONALITY, OR MERCHANTABILITY, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF
STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST
PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW. DOMESTIQUE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS,
INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE
INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE
CONTROL OF DOMESTIQUE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER DOMESTIQUE
NOR ANY OF ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR
GUARANTEE AS TO THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, TRUTH,
AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY PRODUCTS OR ANY CONTENT THEREIN
OR GENERATED THEREWITH, OR THAT: (A) THE USE OF ANY PRODUCTS WILL BE SECURE,
TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; (B) THE PRODUCTS WILL OPERATE IN
COMBINATION WITH ANY OTHER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, OR DATA; (C) THE
PRODUCTS (OR ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED
OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE PRODUCTS) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR
EXPECTATIONS); (D) ANY STORED DATA WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE OR THAT ANY
STORED DATA WILL NOT BE LOST OR CORRUPTED; (E) ERRORS OR DEFECTS WILL BE
CORRECTED; OR (F) THE PRODUCTS (OR ANY SERVER(S) THAT MAKE A HOSTED SERVICE
AVAILABLE) ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

<p>19 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL BE
LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY
MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, COSTS OF DELAY OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST
PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. NEITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO
THE OTHER SHALL EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO US FOR PRODUCTS AND
SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE IN THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU
IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS SHALL BE US$20. THIS SECTION 19 (LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY) SHALL NOT APPLY TO (1) AMOUNTS OWED BY YOU UNDER ANY ORDERS, (2)
EITHER PARTY’S EXPRESS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR (3)
YOUR BREACH OF SECTION 12 (RESTRICTIONS) OR SECTION 2 (COMBINING THE PRODUCTS
WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE) OF THIRD PARTY CODE IN DOMESTIQUE PRODUCTS). TO THE
MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO SUPPLIERS OF ANY THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS
INCLUDED IN THE PRODUCTS WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER. The
parties agree that the limitations specified in this Section 19 (Limitation of
Liability) will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this
Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

<p>20 IP Indemnification by Domestique. We will defend you against any claim
brought against you by a third party alleging that a Product, when used as
authorized under this Agreement, infringes a United States or European Union
patent or registered copyright (a “Claim”), and we will indemnify you and hold
you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded by a court of
competent jurisdiction or agreed to settlement by Domestique (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of a Claim, provided that we have
received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the claim (but in any event
notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice); (b) reasonable
assistance in the defense and investigation of the claim, including providing
us a copy of the claim and all relevant evidence in your possession, custody or
control; and (c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation,
defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the claim. If your use of a Product
is (or in our opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement, or
if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material
liability, we may, at our option and in our discretion: (i) procure a license
for your continued use of the Product in accordance with this Agreement; (ii)
substitute a substantially functionally similar Product; or (iii) terminate
your right to continue using the Product and refund, in the case of Software,
the license fee paid by you as reduced to reflect a three year straight-line
depreciation from the license purchase date, and in the case of a Hosted
Service, any prepaid amounts for the terminated portion of the Subscription
Term. Domestique’s indemnification obligations above do not apply: (1) if the
total aggregate fees received by Domestique with respect to your license to
Software or subscription to Hosted Services in the 12 month period immediately
preceding the claim is less than US$50,000; (2) if the Product is modified by
any party other than Domestique, but solely to the extent the alleged
infringement is caused by such modification; (3) if the Product is used in
combination with any non-Domestique product, software or equipment, but solely
to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to
unauthorized use of Products; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of (y) Your
Data (or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in Section
7.7.3 (Indemnity for Your Data)) or (z) any third-party deliverables or
components contained with the Products; (6) to any unsupported release of the
Software; or (7) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a claim
without Domestique’s prior written consent. THIS SECTION 20 (IP INDEMNIFICATION
BY DOMESTIQUE) STATES OUR SOLE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PRODUCT OR
OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY DOMESTIQUE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

<p>21 Third Party Vendor Products. Domestique or third parties may from time to
time make available to you (e.g., through the Domestique Marketplace)
third-party products or services, including but not limited to add-ons and
plugins as well as implementation, customization, training, and other
consulting services. If you procure any of these third party products or
services, you do so under a separate agreement (and exchange of data) solely
between you and the third party vendor. Domestique does not warrant or support
non-Domestique products or services, whether or not they are designated by
Domestique as “verified” or otherwise, and disclaims all liability for such
products or services. If you install or enable any third party products or
services for use with Domestique products, you acknowledge that Domestique may
allow the vendors of those products and services to access Your Data as
required for the interoperation and support of such add-ons with the Domestique
products. Domestique shall not be responsible for any disclosure, modification
or deletion of Your Data resulting from any such access by third party add-on
vendors.</p>

<p>22 Publicity Rights. We may identify you as an Domestique customer in our
promotional materials. You may request that we stop doing so by submitting an
email to support@domestiquestudios.com at any time. Please note that it may take us up to
30 days to process your request.</p>

<p>23 Improving Our Products. We are always striving to improve our Products.
In order to do so, we need to measure, analyze, and aggregate how users
interact with our Products, such as usage patterns and characteristics of our
user base. We collect and use analytics data regarding the use of our Products
as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>24 Dispute Resolution</h3>

<p>24.1 Dispute Resolution; Arbitration. In the event of any controversy or
claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the parties hereto shall
consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests,
attempt to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If the parties do not
reach settlement within a period of 60 days, any unresolved controversy or
claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall proceed to binding
arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce. The parties shall seek to mutually appoint an arbitrator. If the
parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then there shall be three (3)
arbitrators: one selected by each party, and a third selected by the first two.
Arbitration will take place in one of the following cities as mutually agreed
between the parties: Chicago, IL or Asheville NC (USA).
If the parties are unable to agree to one of these cities,
then the arbitration shall proceed in Asheville, NC. All negotiations and
arbitration proceedings pursuant to this Section will be confidential and
treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar
rules and codes of evidence of applicable legislation and jurisdictions. The
language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>

<p>24.2 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of North Carolina,
USA, without giving effect to the principles of that State relating to
conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or
proceeding that is not otherwise subject to the arbitration provisions of
Section 24.1 (Dispute Resolution; Arbitration) must be brought solely and
exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other
applicable procedural rules of, the State or Federal court in Asheville,
North Carolina, USA, and each party irrevocably submits to the sole and exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the courts in Asheville, NC, USA,
generally and unconditionally, with respect to any action, suit or proceeding
brought by it or against it by the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Domestique may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>24.3 Injunctive Relief; Enforcement. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 24.1 (Dispute Resolution; Arbitration), nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation
of intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations or enforcement or
recognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction.</p>

<p>24.4 Exclusion of UN Convention and UCITA. The terms of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement.
The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) shall not apply to
this Agreement regardless of when or where adopted.</p>

<p>25 Export Restrictions. The Products are subject to export restrictions by
the United States government and import restrictions by certain foreign
governments, and you agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws
and regulations in your use of the Products. You shall not (and shall not allow
any third-party to) remove or export from the United States or allow the export
or re-export of any part of the Products or any direct product thereof: (a)
into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting
country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders
or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to
any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or
as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an
export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or
re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) otherwise in
violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any
United States or foreign agency or authority. You represent and warrant that
(i) you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of
any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list and (ii) that
none of Your Data is controlled under the US International Traffic in Arms
Regulations. The Products are restricted from being used for the design or
development of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology
without the prior permission of the United States government.</p>

<p>26 Changes to this Agreement. We may update or modify this Agreement from
time to time, including any referenced policies and other documents. If a
revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to
notify you (by, for example, sending an email to the billing or technical
contact you designate in the applicable Order, posting on our blog, through
your Domestique account, or in the Product itself). If we modify the Agreement
during your License Term or Subscription Term, the modified version will be
effective upon your next renewal of a License Term, Support and Maintenance
term, or Subscription Term, as applicable. In this case, if you object to the
updated Agreement, as your exclusive remedy, you may choose not to renew,
including cancelling any terms set to auto-renew. With respect to No-Charge
Products, accepting the updated Agreement is required for you to continue using
the No-Charge Products. You may be required to click through the updated
Agreement to show your acceptance. If you do not agree to the updated Agreement
after it becomes effective, you will no longer have a right to use No-Charge
Products. For the avoidance of doubt, any Order is subject to the version of
the Agreement in effect at the time of the Order.</p>

<p>27 General Provisions. Any notice under this Agreement must be given in
writing. We may provide notice to you via email or through your account. Our
notices to you will be deemed given upon the first business day after we send
it. You may provide notice to us by post to Domestique Studios, c/o Domestique,
{# TODO REPLACE #}
Inc., 123 Carroll Ave, Asheville, NC, USA 28801, Attn: General
Counsel. Your notices to us will be deemed given upon our receipt. Neither
party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any
obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay
or failure is due to unforeseen events which are beyond the reasonable control
of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural
disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data
networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency. You may
not assign this Agreement without our prior written consent. We will not
unreasonably withhold our consent if the assignee agrees to be bound by the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. We may assign our rights and
obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in part) without your consent.
The Products are commercial computer software. If you are an agency,
department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use,
duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of
the Products, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical
data and manuals, is restricted by the terms of this Agreement in accordance
with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The
Products were developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited.
This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Domestique relating to
the Products and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Products or
any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. If any provision of this
Agreement is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other
provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may not be
modified or amended by you without our written agreement (which may be withheld
in our complete discretion without any requirement to provide any explanation).
As used herein, “including” (and its variants) means “including without
limitation” (and its variants). No failure or delay by the injured party to
this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder at law or equity. The parties are independent
contractors. This Agreement shall not be construed as constituting either party
as a partner of the other or to create any other form of legal association that
would give on party the express or implied right, power or authority to create
any duty or obligation of the other party.</p>
