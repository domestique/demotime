<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Effective starting: July 1, 2016</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information Domestique Studios and its
related entities ("Domestique") collect about you and why, what we do with that
information, how we share it, and how we handle the content you place in our
products and services. It also explains the choices available to you regarding
our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this
information.</p>

<h3>Scope of Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through your use of "Domestique Services" via a "Device" or when you otherwise interact with Domestique.</p>

<p>"Domestique Services" include our:</p>

<ul>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>SaaS Products</li>
<li>Downloadable Products</li>
</ul>

<p>but does not include:</p>

<p>Domestique products or services for which a separate privacy policy is provided.</p>

<p>Third Party Products. These are third party products or services that you
may choose to integrate with Domestique product or services, such as third
party Add-Ons available in the Domestique Marketplace. You should always review
the policies of third party products and services to make sure you are
comfortable with the ways in which they collect and use your information.</p>

<p>A "Device" is any computer used to access the Domestique Services, including
without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer
electronic device.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, our SaaS Products and our Downloadable Products are
treated the same for the purposes of this document.</p>

<p>By registering for or using Domestique Services you consent to the
collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described
in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>Add-On: a bundle of code, resources and configuration files that can be used
with an Domestique product to add new functionality or to change the behavior
of that product's existing features.</p>

<p>Content: any information or data that you upload, submit, post, create,
transmit, store or display in an Domestique Service.</p>

<p>Downloadable Products: Domestique's downloadable software products and
mobile applications, including Add-Ons created by Domestique, that are
installed by customers on an infrastructure of their choice. Downloadable
Products do not include Add-Ons created by third parties, even when they are
accessed through any server where demoti.me has been installed.</p>

<p>Information: all of the different forms of data, content, and information
collected by us as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Personal Information: information that may be used to readily identify or
contact you as an individual person, such as: name, address, email address, or
phone number. Personal Information does not include information that has been
anonymized such that it does not allow for the ready identification of specific
individuals.</p>

<p>SaaS Products: Domestique's "Cloud" hosted solutions, as well as other
Domestique hosted solutions that display a link to this Privacy Policy (such as
HipChat and Bitbucket). For the avoidance of doubt, if an Domestique hosted
solution displays a link to a different privacy policy, then that other privacy
policy shall apply.</p>

<p>Websites: Domestique's websites, including but not limited to domestiquestudios.com,
and demoti.me, and any related websites.</p>

<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes,
we will notify you by revising the "Effective Starting" date at the top of this
Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes, we will provide you with
additional notice (such as by adding a notice on the Domestique Services
homepages, login screens, or by sending you an email notification). We
encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you use Domestique Services
to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help
protect your privacy.</p>

<p>If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Policy, you will need to
stop using Domestique Services and deactivate your account(s).</p>

<h3>Information you provide to us</h3>

<p>We collect the following information:</p>

<p>Account and Profile Information: We collect information about you and your
company as you register for an account, create or modify your profile, make
purchases through, use, access, or interact with the Domestique Services
(including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or
share Content). Information we collect includes</p>

<p>Contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, and phone
number</p>

<p>Billing information such as credit card details and billing address</p>

<p>Profile information such as a username, profile photo, and job title</p>

<p>Preferences information such as notification and marketing preferences</p>

<p>You may provide this information directly when you enter it in Domestique
Services.</p>

<p>In some cases another user (such as a system administrator) may create an
account on your behalf and may provide your information, including Personal
Information (most commonly when your company requests that you use our
products). We collect Information under the direction of our customers and
often have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we
process. If you are an employee of one of our customers and would no longer
like us to process your information, please contact your employer. If you are
providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you
must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and
use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Content: We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post,
upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our SaaS Products or
Websites. Such Content includes any Personal Information or other sensitive
information that you choose to include ("incidentally-collected Personal
Information").</p>

<p>Other submissions: We collect other data that you submit to our Websites or
as you participate in any interactive features of the Domestique Services,
participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event,
apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third party
social media sites or otherwise communicate with us. For example, information
regarding a problem you are experiencing with an Domestique product could be
submitted to our Support Services or posted in our public forums.</p>

<h3>Information we collect from your use of Domestique Services</h3>

<p>Web Logs: As is true with most websites and services delivered over the
Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you
interact with our Websites and SaaS Products. This information includes
internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service
provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp,
information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification
numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, and system
configuration information. In the case of our SaaS Product, the URLs you
accessed (and therefore included in our log files) include usernames as well as
elements of Content (such as Demotime project names, project keys, status names,
and JQL filters, and Confluence page titles and space names) as necessary for
the SaaS Product to perform the requested operations. Occasionally, we connect
Personal Information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to
improve Domestique Services for individual customers. In such a case, we would
treat the combined Information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>Analytics Information from Website and SaaS Products: We collect analytics
information when you use our Websites and SaaS Products to help us improve our
products and services. In the SaaS Products, this analytics information
consists of the feature and function of the Domestique Service being used, the
associated license identifier (SEN) and domain name, the username and IP
address of the individual who is using the feature or function (which will
include Personal Information if the Personal Information was incorporated into
the username), the sizes and original filenames of attachments, and additional
information required to detail the operation of the function and which parts of
the Domestique Services are being affected. For example:</p>

<p>In Demotime, analytics information that we collect when a user creates a
project includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the project, the
project key input by the user, the name of the template used (if any), and the
name of the project. Similarly, analytics information that we collect when an
issue is edited includes the system-assigned numeric issue id, the issue key
(which consists of the project key and a system-generated sequence number),
whether the edit is made by a user or automatically generated by the system,
and whether email notifications are to be sent.</p>

<p>As shown in the examples above, the analytics information we collect
includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing. As
such, the analytics information we collect may include Personal Information or
sensitive business information that the user has included in Content that the
user chose to upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in an
Domestique Service.</p>

<p>As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics as an
analytics provider. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics,
refer to Google's Policies and Principles. Use the Google Analytics Opt-out
Browser Add-on to prevent analytics information from being sent to Google
Analytics.</p>

<p>Analytics Information Derived from Content. Analytics information also
consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content
across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. "Usage Data" is
aggregated data about a group or category of services, features or users that
does not contain Personal Information. For example, we may query Content to
determine the most common types of workflows that users use (e.g. what
percentage of all instances use ITIL style workflows?) by searching for the
most common workflow names, or we may query Content to determine the most
popular job titles for Confluence users in order to better understand the
composition of our user base.</p>

<p>Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile
Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our
efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort
by us to examine the Content of any particular customer.</p>

<p>Analytics Information from Downloadable Products: We collect analytics
information when you use our Downloadable Products to help us improve our
products and services. Our Downloadable Products contain a feature that sends
information about the technical operation of the Downloadable Products on your
systems ("System Information") to us. System Information includes information
about (a) the server environment in which the Downloadable Product is
operating: OS type and version, JVM version, Java environment properties, CPU
type, RAM allocation, language and locale settings, database type and version,
and disk utilization, as well as (b) user client information, for example:
browser type and version, native client type and version, and client device
specifications (e.g. screen resolution, OS version, device type, etc.). In
addition, we collect analytics information from Downloadable Products that is a
subset of the analytics information described above for Websites and SaaS
Products. As with Websites and SaaS Products, the analytics information we
collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is
performing, but with an important caveat. With the Downloadable Products,
before sending the information to Domestique's servers, we filter the analytics
information to remove elements that we believe may contain sensitive or
Personal Information. For example: (1) we conduct a one-way hash of usernames
and hostnames before collecting them and (2) we filter any Content elements we
collect to discard all words except those on a list of common business and IT
terminology. You can disable our collection of analytics information from
Downloadable Products via the Administrator settings or by blocking collection
at the local network level.</p>

<p>Installer Analytics, Software Updates & License Information from
Downloadable Products: During the installation of our Downloadable Products,
the installer sends analytics information to Domestique to allow us to
understand where in the installation process users are experiencing trouble or
dropping out. Our Downloadable Products also communicate with Domestique
servers for licensing purposes, as well as to check for updates, patches, and
compatibility with Add-Ons. Examples of information we collect for these
purposes include the name and version of the Downloadable Product and the
server ID, SEN, and IP address of the customer instance.</p>

<p>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Domestique and our third party
partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use various
technologies to collect information, such as cookies and web beacons. Cookies
are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. We use
cookies to improve and customize Domestique Services and your experience; to
allow you to access and use the Websites or SaaS Products without re-entering
your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and
features of the Websites and SaaS Products are most popular. You can instruct
your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt
you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit. If you do not accept
cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Websites or
SaaS Products. Domestique and our third party partners also collect information
using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic
images that may be used in our Websites or SaaS Products or in emails that help
us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign
effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted
upon.</p>

<p>Domestique uses javascript and HTML5 local storage to collect information
about your online activities over time and across different websites or online
services. Many browsers include their own management tools for removing HTML5
local storage objects.</p>

<h3>Information we collect from other sources</h3>

<p>Information from third party services: We also obtain information from third
parties and combine that with Information we collect through Domestique
Services. For example, we may have access to certain information from a third
party social media or authentication service if you log into Domestique
Services through the service or otherwise provide us with access to Information
from the service. Any access that we may have to such Information from a third
party social or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization
procedures determined by that service. By authorizing us to connect with a
third party service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email
address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the
third party service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in
accordance with this Privacy Policy. You should check your privacy settings on
these third party services to understand and change the information sent to us
through these services.</p>

<h3>How we use Information we collect</h3>

<p>General Uses: We use the Information we collect about you (including
Personal Information to the extent applicable) for a variety of purposes,
including to:</p>

<p>Provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote Domestique Services;</p>

<p>Enable you to access and use Domestique Services, including uploading,
downloading, collaborating on and sharing Content;</p>

<p>Process and complete transactions, and send you related information,
including purchase confirmations and invoices;</p>

<p>Send transactional messages, including responding to your comments,
questions, and requests; providing customer service and support; and sending
you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative
messages;</p>

<p>Send promotional communications, such as providing you with information
about services, features, surveys, newsletters, offers, promotions, contests,
events and sending updates about your team and chat rooms; and providing other
news or information about us and our select partners.</p>

<p>Process and deliver contest or sweepstakes entries and rewards;</p>

Domestique Services and for marketing or advertising purposes;</p>

or advertisements that match your interests and preferences;</p>

<p>Enable you to communicate, collaborate, and share Content with users you
designate; and</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not use Personal Information
appearing in our Analytics Logs or Web Logs for any purpose. The use of
Information collected through our Domestique Services shall be limited to the
purposes disclosed in this policy.</p>

<p>Compiling aggregate analytics information: Because our SaaS Products and
Downloadable Products are some of the most configurable in the market, we make
extensive use of analytics information (including log and configuration data)
to understand how our products are being configured and used, how they can be
improved for the benefit of all of our users, and to develop new products and
services. As such we generate Usage Data (as defined above) from the web logs
and analytics logs described above, including the Content elements captured in
such logs, as well as from the Content stored in the Websites and SaaS
Products.</p>

<h3>Information sharing and disclosure</h3>

<p>We will not share or disclose any of your Personal Information or Content
with third parties except as described in this policy. We do not sell your
Personal Information or Content.</p>

<p>Your Use: When you use Domestique Services, Content you provide will be
displayed back to you. Certain features of Domestique Services allow you or
your administrator to make some of your Content public, in which case it will
become readily accessible to anyone. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of
any data you input into Domestique Services.</p>

<p>Collaboration: As a natural result of using Domestique Services, you may
create Content and grant permission to other Domestique users to access it for
the purposes of collaboration. Some of the collaboration features of Domestique
Services display your profile information, including Personal Information
included in your profile, to users with whom you have shared your Content.
Where this information is sensitive, we urge you to use the various security
and privacy features of the Domestique Services to limit those who can access
such information. Your sharing settings may make any Information, including
some Personal Information, that you submit to the Domestique Services visible
to the public, unless submitted to a restricted area.</p>

<p>Access by your system administrator: You should be aware that the
administrator of your instance of Domestique Services may be able to:</p>

<p>access information in and about your Domestique Services account;</p>

<p>access communications history, including file attachments, for your
Domestique Services account;</p>

<p>disclose, restrict, or access information that you have provided or that is
made available to you when using your Domestique Services account, including
your Content; and</p>

<p>control how your Domestique Services account may be accessed or deleted.</p>

<p>Domestique Community: Our Websites offer publicly accessible community
services such as blogs, forums, bug trackers, and wikis. You should be aware
that any Content you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by
others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your
account. To request removal of your Personal Information from the Domestique
Community, please contact us using the information listed below. In some cases,
we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will
let you know if we are unable to and why.</p>

<p>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others: We work with third party
service providers to provide website, application development, hosting,
maintenance, back-up, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing,
analysis and other services for us. These service providers may have access to
or process your Information for the purpose of providing those services for us.
Some of our pages utilize white-labeling techniques to serve content from our
service providers while providing the look and feel of our site. Please be
aware that you are providing your Information to these third parties acting on
behalf of Domestique.</p>

<p>Third Party Add-Ons: You may choose to make use of third party Add-Ons in
conjunction with Domestique Services. Third party Add-Ons are software written
by third parties to which you grant access privileges to your Content (which
may include your Personal Information). When access is granted, your Content is
shared with the third party. Third party Add-On policies and procedures are not
controlled by Domestique even though the third party Add-On may be available
through Domestique Services. Third parties who have been granted access to your
Content through Add-Ons could use this data to contact you and market services
to you, and could share your data with other third parties. This Privacy Policy
does not cover the collection or use of your data by third party Add-Ons, and
we urge you to consider the privacy policies governing third party Add-Ons. If
you object to your Personal Information being shared with these third parties,
please uninstall the Add-On (in the event installed from the Domestique
Marketplace) or terminate your agreement with the third party Add-On provider
(in the event you have purchased a direct integration).</p>

<p>Links to Third Party Sites: The Domestique Services may include links to
other websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit
Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by
their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy
of any website you visit.</p>

<p>Social Media Widgets: The Domestique Services may contain social media
features, such as the Twitter "tweet" button. These features may collect your
IP address, which page you are visiting on the Domestique Services, and may set
a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and
Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Domestique
Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy
policy of the company providing it.</p>

<p>Testimonials: We may display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on
the Domestique Services. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along

<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Our Rights:
We may disclose your Information (including your Personal Information) to a
third party if (a) we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply
with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b)
to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) to protect the
security or integrity of Domestique's products and services, (d) to protect
Domestique, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e)
to respond to an emergency which we believe in the good faith requires us to
disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury
of any person.</p>

your Personal Information) in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion
of our business to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a
prominent notice on the Domestique Services of any change in ownership or uses
of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding
your Personal Information.</p>

<p>Aggregated or Anonymized Data: We may also share aggregated or anonymized
information that does not directly identify you with the third parties
described above.</p>

parties when we have your consent to do so.</p>

<h3>Information we do not share</h3>

<p>We do not share Personal Information about you with third parties for their
marketing purposes (including direct marketing purposes) without your
permission.</p>

<p>Data storage, transfer and security</p>

<p>Where data is transferred over the Internet as part of a Website or SaaS
Product, the data is encrypted using industry standard SSL (HTTPS).</p>

<p>Where Downloadable Products are used, responsibility of securing access to
the data you store in the Downloadable Products rests with you and not
Domestique. We strongly recommend that administrators of Downloadable Products
configure SSL to prevent interception of data transmitted over networks and to
restrict access to the databases and other storage used to hold data.</p>

<h3>Your Choices</h3>

<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Domestique by
using the unsubscribe link within each email, or emailing us to have your
contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration
database. Although opt-out requests are usually processed immediately, please
allow ten (10) business days for a removal request to be processed. Even after
you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to
receive transactional messages from us regarding Domestique's Services. You can
opt-out of some notification messages in your account settings.</p>

<p>You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from
companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who
subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for
Online Behavioral Advertising. For more information about this practice and to
understand your options, please visit: http://www.aboutads.info and

your account settings or by directing your query to your account administrator.
You may also contact Support Services, or contact us by postal mail using the

days.</p>

<p>You can often remove Content using editing tools associated with that
Content. In some cases, you may need to contact your administrator to request
they remove the Content. You can contact us to request removal of Personal
Information from Domestique Community services.</p>

<p>You or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Domestique Services
account. If you can deactivate your own account, you can most often do so in
your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. To
deactivate an organization account, please contact Support Services. To
deactivate an account made for you without authorization, please contact us at
the contact information below.</p>

<p>We will retain your account information for as long as your account is
active, or as reasonably useful for commercial purposes or as necessary to
comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
agreements. If your account is managed by an administrator, that account
administrator may have control with regards to how your account information is
retained and deleted.</p>

<h3>Our policy towards children</h3>

<p>Domestique Services are not directed to individuals under 13. We do not
knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we become

provided us with Personal Information, please contact our Support Services.</p>
